Snake Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python and Pygame. The Snake Game is a popular arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it collects food. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the edges of the game window or the snake's own body.

Features:
- Basic snake movement with arrow keys
- Snake grows longer with each food item eaten
- Game over when snake hits the boundaries or its own body

This game serves as a beginner-level project for learning Python and game development concepts. It demonstrates the usage of Pygame, a popular Python library for game development.
